## The Seven Principles

### 1. Emotion Before Logic

**Principle:** Acknowledge the other person's feelings before presenting facts or arguments.

**Why:** People can't hear logic when they're emotionally activated. Validation unlocks listening.

**Application:**
- Lead with acknowledgment: "I understand this is frustrating..."
- Label their likely emotion before responding to content
- Don't argue with feelings, acknowledge them

**Transform:**
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "The contract clearly states..." | "I can see why this feels unfair. The contract states..." |
| "You're wrong because..." | "It sounds like you see this differently. Here's my perspective..." |

### 2. "No" Is Safe

**Principle:** Allow the other person to say "no" without consequence. "No" starts negotiation.

**Why:** People feel safe saying no. Pushing for "yes" creates resistance. "No" reveals real concerns.

**Application:**
- Frame requests as things they can refuse: "Would it be unreasonable to..."
- Accept initial "no" as information, not failure
- Ask what they CAN agree to after hearing "no"

**Transform:**
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "You need to agree to this" | "Is there any reason you couldn't consider this?" |
| "Say yes or I walk" | "What would need to change for this to work?" |

### 3. Questions Over Statements

**Principle:** Ask questions instead of making demands. Questions engage; demands trigger resistance.

**Why:** Questions invite collaboration. Statements invite pushback. Questions make them think.

**Application:**
- Replace "You must..." with "How can we..."
- Replace accusations with curiosity
- Use "What" and "How" questions (not "Why")

**Transform:**
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "You need to pay by Friday" | "What would make it possible to settle this by Friday?" |
| "This is unacceptable" | "How do you see us resolving this?" |
| "Why did you do that?" | "What led to that decision?" |

### 4. Control Yourself, Not Them

**Principle:** Focus on what you can control - your actions, words, responses. Not their behavior.

**Why:** You can't control others. Trying creates frustration. Control your moves, influence theirs.

**Application:**
- State what YOU will do, not what THEY must do
- Describe consequences, don't threaten outcomes you can't control
- Focus on your response to scenarios

**Transform:**
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "You will regret this" | "I'll need to consider my options" |
| "Make her agree" | "Here's what I'm prepared to offer" |
| "Stop being difficult" | "I'm going to step back and reassess" |

### 5. Channeled > Raw

**Principle:** Same energy, strategic delivery. Anger is information, not instruction.

**Why:** Raw emotion gets quoted against you. Channeled emotion shows strength without giving ammunition.

**Application:**
- Feel the anger, but filter the expression
- Firm is good, aggressive is exploitable
- Controlled intensity > explosive outburst

**Transform:**
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "I'm furious about this!" | "This is a serious problem that needs resolution." |
| "You're trying to screw me" | "I'm concerned about the fairness of this arrangement." |
| "Go to hell" | "I don't see a path forward with this approach." |

### 6. Written Is Permanent

**Principle:** Assume every word will be screenshot, forwarded, read by lawyers, shown to judges.

**Why:** Written communication creates evidence. What feels cathartic today becomes exhibit A tomorrow.

**Application:**
- Before sending: "Would I be okay if this was read in court?"
- Remove anything that sounds threatening when quoted out of context
- Write for the audience who will use it against you

**Transform:**
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "I'll make sure everyone knows what you did" | [delete entirely] |
| "You'll never see the kids again" | "I want to discuss custody arrangements." |
| "This is war" | "I'm prepared to pursue formal resolution." |

---

### 7. Controlled Looks Stronger

**Principle:** Calm firmness signals strength. Visible emotion signals weakness or instability.

**Why:** The person who loses control loses credibility. Steady resolve is more intimidating than explosive threats.

**Application:**
- Short sentences. No ranting.
- State facts, not feelings (about them)
- Let silence do work

**Transform:**
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Long emotional paragraph | Three clear sentences |
| "I can't believe you would..." | "This doesn't work for me." |
| Multiple exclamation marks!!! | Period. |

## The Audit Checklist

Before any high-stakes communication:

- [ ] Did I acknowledge their perspective/emotion first?
- [ ] Can they safely say "no" to my request?
- [ ] Am I asking questions or making demands?
- [ ] Am I focused on what I control?
- [ ] Is my energy channeled or raw?
- [ ] Would I be okay if this was read in court?
- [ ] Do I sound controlled or reactive?

If any answer is "no," revise before sending.
