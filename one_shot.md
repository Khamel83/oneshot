# ONE_SHOT_CONTRACT (do not remove)
```yaml
oneshot:
  version: 2.1

  # ============================================================================
  # PRIME DIRECTIVE: FRONT-LOAD EVERYTHING
  # ============================================================================
  # The user answers questions ONCE. Then the agent works autonomously.
  # The user should be able to walk away after PRD approval.
  # 5 minutes of questions → 5 hours of uninterrupted autonomous work.
  # ============================================================================

  prime_directive:
    philosophy: |
      ONE_SHOT exists to MINIMIZE user interruptions during development.
      All information gathering happens UPFRONT, before any code is written.
      Once the PRD is approved, the agent works autonomously until done.

    rules:
      - "Ask ALL questions before writing ANY code"
      - "NEVER interrupt the user mid-build for information you could have asked upfront"
      - "If you discover you need new information, BATCH questions together"
      - "Validate answers immediately - don't discover problems 2 hours into coding"
      - "The user's time is precious - your compute time is cheap"

    information_flow:
      intake_phase:
        duration: "5-15 minutes of user time"
        goal: "Gather EVERYTHING needed to build autonomously"
        output: "Complete PRD with no ambiguity"

      autonomous_phase:
        duration: "Minutes to hours of agent work"
        goal: "Build the entire project without interruption"
        user_involvement: "ZERO - user can walk away"
        interruption_allowed: "Only for hard_stops (see below)"

    anti_patterns:
      - "Asking one question at a time over multiple messages"
      - "Discovering missing requirements mid-implementation"
      - "Interrupting to ask 'should I also do X?'"
      - "Waiting for approval on obvious next steps"
      - "Asking the same question twice in different forms"

  # File architecture guidance
  architecture:
    current_size: "~18K tokens"
    growth_ceiling: "30-40K tokens before restructure needed"
    restructure_note: |
      Skills extracted to secrets-vault/SKILLS.md in v2.1.
      If more extraction needed, add to secrets-vault as companion files.
    priority_order: |
      1. YAML header (always parsed first)
      2. Part I Sections 0-7 (core flow - agent keeps hot)
      3. Part I Sections 8-16 (supporting patterns)
      4. Part II-III (reference on demand)
      5. Part IV (appendix - skim only)
    growth_rules:
      - "Add new core patterns to Part I only if used in >50% of projects"
      - "Add new reference material to Part II-III"
      - "Skills and templates go in Part IV (appendix)"
      - "If Part IV exceeds 40% of file, consider SKILLS.md companion"

  enforcement:
    presence_rule: >
      If ONE_SHOT.md exists in a repo, agents MUST treat it as the governing
      spec for questions, PRD, implementation order, ops, and AI usage.
    prd_rule: >
      Any non-trivial change (new feature, storage change, deployment change)
      MUST go through PRD update before code changes.
    storage_rule: >
      Agents MUST NOT introduce PostgreSQL unless data_scale is Large (Q8 = C)
      or requirements clearly demand it AND user explicitly approves.
    mode_rule: >
      Agents MUST respect the selected mode's skip_sections when planning
      and implementing work.
    reality_check_rule: >
      If Q2.5 is answered "No, but I might someday" and the project is not
      explicitly marked as a learning project, agents MUST stop after PRD and
      only proceed if the user types the override phrase 'Override Reality Check'.
    llm_overview_rule: >
      Every ONE_SHOT project MUST have an LLM-OVERVIEW.md file that provides
      complete context for a blank-slate LLM to understand the project.
    front_load_rule: >
      Agents MUST gather ALL required information during intake phase.
      NEVER interrupt autonomous build phase for information that could

<!-- ONESHOT_CORE_START -->

# PART I: CORE SPECIFICATION

<!-- SECTION:0:HOW_TO_USE -->

# 0. HOW TO USE THIS FILE

This file is meant to be loaded into an IDE agent (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) and used as the **single spec** for building projects.

<!-- SECTION:0.0:TRIAGE_LAYER -->

## 0.0 TRIAGE LAYER (First Contact Protocol)

**CRITICAL: This runs BEFORE anything else. Before reconnaissance. Before questions.**

When an agent encounters a project with ONE_SHOT.md, or receives any user request, the FIRST action is TRIAGE - understanding what the user actually needs.

### 0.0.1 Intent Classification

**Before doing ANYTHING, classify the user's intent:**

```yaml
intent_classification:
  build_new:
    signals: ["new project", "build me", "create", "start fresh", "greenfield"]
    action: "Full ONE_SHOT flow → Reconnaissance → Core Questions → PRD → Build"

  fix_existing:
    signals: ["broken", "not working", "bug", "error", "fix", "debug"]
    action: "Diagnostic Mode → Gather symptoms → Isolate → Fix → Verify"

  continue_work:
    signals: ["continue", "resume", "pick up where", "last session"]
    action: "Context Recovery → Load checkpoint → Summarize state → Resume"

  modify_existing:
    signals: ["add feature", "change", "update", "modify", "extend"]
    action: "Scope Assessment → Impact analysis → Mini-PRD → Implement"

  understand:
    signals: ["explain", "how does", "what is", "show me", "walk through"]
    action: "Research Mode → Read code → Explain → No code changes"

  quick_task:
    signals: ["just", "quickly", "simple", "one-liner", "script"]
    action: "Micro Mode check → If truly micro, skip to Section 2.1"
```

```

### 0.0.3 Diagnostic Mode (For "It's Broken" Scenarios)

When user says something is broken/not working:

```yaml
diagnostic_protocol:
  step_1_symptoms:
    ask: "What behavior are you seeing vs what you expected?"
    gather:
      - "What error message (if any)?"
      - "When did it last work?"
      - "What changed since then?"

  step_2_reproduce:
    action: "Try to reproduce the issue yourself"
    commands:
      - "Run the failing command/action"
      - "Check logs: docker logs, journalctl, app logs"
      - "Check health endpoints if applicable"

  step_3_isolate:
    layers:
      - "Network: Can you reach the service?"
      - "Process: Is it running?"
      - "Config: Any recent changes?"
      - "Dependencies: All services up?"
      - "Data: Database accessible?"

  step_4_fix:
    approach: "Smallest change that fixes the issue"
    avoid: "Do NOT refactor while debugging"

  step_5_verify:
    action: "Confirm fix, document what broke and why"

  anti_pattern: |
    DO NOT run the full ONE_SHOT flow for a bug fix.
    User said "it's broken" - they want it fixed, not rebuilt.
```

### 0.0.4 Context Recovery Protocol (For Partial Handoffs)

When resuming work from a previous session or different agent:

```yaml
context_recovery:
  step_1_check_artifacts:
    files:
      - ".oneshot/checkpoint.yaml"  # Checkpoint from previous session
      - "PRD.md"                    # Approved requirements
      - "LLM-OVERVIEW.md"           # Project context doc
      - ".oneshot/decisions.log"    # Past decisions
      - "git log --oneline -20"     # Recent commits

  step_2_summarize_state:
    output: |
      "Here's what I found:
      - Project: [name]
      - Last checkpoint: [phase/task]
      - Recent work: [last 3 commits]
      - Outstanding: [pending tasks]

      Ready to continue from [specific task], or need to catch up first?"

  step_3_gap_detection:
    check:
      - "Any TODO comments in code?"
      - "Any failing tests?"
      - "Any incomplete features in PRD?"

  step_4_handoff_complete:
    confirm: "Does this summary match your understanding?"
    proceed: "Continue from checkpoint"

  incomplete_handoff:
    if: "No checkpoint, no PRD, but code exists"
    action: |
      "I found code but no ONE_SHOT artifacts. Options:
      1. Generate LLM-OVERVIEW.md from existing code (understand first)
      2. Retrofit ONE_SHOT patterns (add structure)
      3. Just help with specific task (no full ONE_SHOT)"
```

### 0.0.5 Scope Assessment (For Modifications)

When user wants to modify an existing project:

```yaml
scope_assessment:
  step_1_understand_request:
    ask: "What feature/change do you want?"

  step_2_impact_analysis:
    check:
      - "Which files will change?"
      - "Any database changes needed?"
      - "Any new dependencies?"
      - "Does this affect other features?"

  step_3_size_classification:
    micro:
      criteria: "<10 lines, single file, no new deps"
      action: "Just do it, no PRD update"
    small:
      criteria: "<100 lines, 1-3 files, no arch changes"
      action: "Document in LLM-OVERVIEW.md, implement"
    medium:
      criteria: "New feature, multiple files, possible deps"
      action: "Mini-PRD → Approval → Implement"
    large:
      criteria: "Architecture change, new service, major refactor"
      action: "Full PRD update → Approval → Phased implementation"

  step_4_propose:
    output: |
      "This looks like a [size] change. My plan:
      1. [step]
      2. [step]

      Should I proceed, or want to discuss first?"
```

### 0.0.6 Graceful Degradation (When ONE_SHOT is Overkill)

Not every task needs the full ONE_SHOT flow:

```yaml
graceful_degradation:
  one_shot_overkill_signals:
    - "Just add a comment"
    - "Rename this variable"
    - "Quick script to..."
    - "Help me understand..."
    - "What does this do?"

  degradation_levels:
    full_oneshot:
      when: "New project, major feature, architectural change"
      flow: "Core Questions → PRD → Autonomous Build"

    mini_oneshot:
      when: "Medium feature, some complexity"
      flow: "Quick scope check → Mini-PRD → Implement"

    direct_action:
      when: "Micro task, clear request, minimal risk"
      flow: "Understand → Do → Verify → Done"

    research_only:
      when: "User wants to understand, not change"
      flow: "Read → Explain → No code changes"

  agent_judgment: |
    Use judgment. A 5-line fix doesn't need 13 Core Questions.
    But a "quick" feature that touches auth definitely does.
    When in doubt, ask: "This seems [small/medium/large]. Full ONE_SHOT flow?"
```

### 0.0.7 "I'm Lost" Recovery

If at any point the agent is confused about what to do:

```yaml
lost_recovery:
  symptoms:
    - "User request doesn't match any intent category"
    - "Project state is inconsistent"
    - "Previous context is missing or contradictory"
    - "Agent doesn't know which section to follow"

  recovery_protocol:
    step_1: "STOP. Don't guess or hallucinate."
    step_2: |
      Ask the user directly:
      "I want to make sure I help you correctly. Can you tell me:
      1. What's the end goal you're trying to achieve?
      2. Is this a new project, existing project, or continuation?
      3. What's the most important thing to get right?"
    step_3: "Based on answers, re-run triage from 0.0.1"

  anti_pattern: |
    DO NOT pretend to understand when confused.
    DO NOT make up context that wasn't provided.
    DO NOT proceed with assumptions on ambiguous requests.

  user_time_cost: "30 seconds to clarify saves 30 minutes of wrong work"
```

### 0.0.8 Environment Mismatch Detection

Check for environment/expectation mismatches early:

```yaml
environment_check:
  quick_sanity:
    - "Does the language/framework match what user described?"
    - "Are expected files present? (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)"
    - "Is this actually a ONE_SHOT project or did user paste spec into non-ONE_SHOT repo?"

  mismatch_handling:
    spec_without_project:
      situation: "ONE_SHOT.md exists but no code"
      action: "This is greenfield - proceed with Core Questions"

    project_without_spec:
      situation: "Code exists but no ONE_SHOT.md"
      action: "Ask: Apply ONE_SHOT patterns, or just help with specific task?"

    spec_mismatch:
      situation: "ONE_SHOT.md describes Python but code is JavaScript"
      action: "Flag mismatch: 'Spec says Python but I see JS. Which is correct?'"

    version_mismatch:
      situation: "Checkpoint says v1.8, current spec is v2.1"
      action: "Note version difference, continue with current spec patterns"
```

### 0.0.9 Triage Output Template

After triage, agent should have a clear answer:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ TRIAGE COMPLETE                                                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Intent: [build_new | fix_existing | continue_work | modify | understand]│
│ Scope:  [micro | small | medium | large | research_only]                │
│ Flow:   [Full ONE_SHOT | Mini-PRD | Direct Action | Research]           │
│ Next:   [Specific next step to take]                                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Example outputs:**

```
Intent: build_new     | Scope: large  | Flow: Full ONE_SHOT | Next: Section 0.2 Reconnaissance
Intent: fix_existing  | Scope: small  | Flow: Direct Action | Next: Diagnostic Mode step 1
Intent: continue_work | Scope: medium | Flow: Resume        | Next: Load checkpoint, summarize state
Intent: modify        | Scope: micro  | Flow: Direct Action | Next: Just make the change
Intent: understand    | Scope: n/a    | Flow: Research      | Next: Read and explain, no changes
```

---

## 0.1 Operational Flow (Human + AI)

1. **Put this file in your repo** as `ONE_SHOT.md`.
2. **Open your dev agent** (Claude Code / Cursor) on that repo.
3. Tell it:

   > "Use `ONE_SHOT.md` as the spec. Ask me all *Core Questions* (Section 2) first. Don't write any code until I say `PRD approved. Execute autonomous build.`"

4. Answer all Core Questions once.
5. Agent generates a PRD (Section 6).
6. You reply: `PRD approved. Execute autonomous build.`
7. Agent runs Section 7 (Autonomous Execution).

This is the contract: *questions once → PRD → autonomous build*.

## 0.2 PROJECT RECONNAISSANCE (Auto-Run on Session Start)

**Before asking ANY questions, the agent MUST run a quick reconnaissance to understand where the project is.**

### 0.2.1 Reconnaissance Checklist (30 seconds)

```yaml
reconnaissance:
  files_to_check:
    - ONE_SHOT.md: "Is this a ONE_SHOT project?"
    - .oneshot/checkpoint.yaml: "Is there a resume point?"
    - LLM-OVERVIEW.md: "What's the project context?"
    - PRD.md: "Is there an approved PRD?"
    - README.md: "What does this project do?"
    - .git: "Is this a git repo?"

  state_detection:
    new_project:
      indicators: ["No ONE_SHOT.md", "Empty or minimal repo"]
      action: "Start fresh - ask Core Questions"

    existing_oneshot_fresh:
      indicators: ["ONE_SHOT.md exists", "No checkpoint", "No PRD"]
      action: "Resume intake - check which questions answered"

    existing_oneshot_prd:
      indicators: ["ONE_SHOT.md exists", "PRD.md exists", "No checkpoint"]
      action: "Ask: 'PRD exists. Resume build or modify PRD?'"

    existing_oneshot_in_progress:
      indicators: ["checkpoint.yaml exists"]
      action: "Resume from checkpoint - show state summary"

    brownfield_no_oneshot:
      indicators: ["Code exists", "No ONE_SHOT.md"]
      action: "Ask: 'Existing project. Apply ONE_SHOT patterns incrementally?'"
```

### 0.2.2 Quick State Detection Script

Agent should mentally run this on session start:

```bash
# What kind of project is this?
if [ -f "ONE_SHOT.md" ]; then
    if [ -f ".oneshot/checkpoint.yaml" ]; then
        echo "STATE: Resume from checkpoint"
    elif [ -f "PRD.md" ]; then
        echo "STATE: PRD exists, ready to build or modify"
    else
        echo "STATE: ONE_SHOT project, needs intake"
    fi
elif [ -d ".git" ] && [ -n "$(ls -A src/ 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
    echo "STATE: Brownfield - existing code, no ONE_SHOT"
else
    echo "STATE: Greenfield - new project"
fi
```

### 0.2.3 State-Dependent First Message

Based on reconnaissance, agent's FIRST message should be:

| State | First Message |
|-------|---------------|
| **Greenfield** | "New project. Let me ask the Core Questions..." |
| **ONE_SHOT Fresh** | "ONE_SHOT project detected. Let me continue intake..." |
| **ONE_SHOT + PRD** | "Found PRD.md. Ready to build, or need changes first?" |
| **Resume** | "[Checkpoint summary]. Ready to continue from [task]?" |
| **Brownfield** | "Existing codebase. Apply ONE_SHOT patterns, or specific task?" |

**This reconnaissance takes <30 seconds and prevents wasted questions.**

---

## 0.3 What's New in v2.1

**v2.1 adds the TRIAGE LAYER - first contact protocol for agents:**

- **TRIAGE LAYER** (Section 0.0) - First 30 seconds of every session
  - Intent Classification (build/fix/continue/modify/understand/quick)
  - Diagnostic Mode for "it's broken" scenarios
  - Context Recovery Protocol for partial handoffs
  - Scope Assessment for modifications
  - Graceful Degradation when ONE_SHOT is overkill
  - "I'm Lost" Recovery for confused agents
  - Environment Mismatch Detection

**The Philosophy**: Understand WHAT the user needs before deciding HOW to help.

Everything from v2.0 remains:
- PRIME DIRECTIVE (Section 2.0)
- Project Reconnaissance (Section 0.2)
- Session Continuity (Sections 7.6-7.7)
- Micro Mode (Section 2.1)
- Hard Stops + Override pattern
- Skills inline (Section 19)
- Secrets management (Section 18)

<!-- SECTION:1:CORE_ETHOS -->

# 1. CORE ETHOS

ONE_SHOT is built on a small set of non-negotiable principles.

## 1.1 Ownership & FOSS

- 100% free & open-source stack where possible.
- No vendor lock-in. Everything runs on:
  - OCI Always Free Tier **or**
  - Your own homelab.
- All services deployable on any Linux box with Docker or systemd.

### 1.1.1 FOSS Stack (Canonical)

```text
Application:   Python / Node / Go / Rust
Web:          FastAPI, Flask, Express, etc.
DB:           PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis
Web server:   Nginx Proxy Manager (web UI for SSL/reverse proxy)
              OR Caddy (if you prefer config files)
DNS:          Cloudflare (free tier, SSL cert management)
OS:           Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (or equivalent)
Network:      Tailscale (free tier, WireGuard based)
VC:           Git + GitHub (or self-hosted Gitea)
Containers:   Docker + Docker Compose (modular includes pattern)
Storage:      MergerFS (pooling) + SnapRAID (parity, optional)
Automation:   Ansible (infrastructure-as-code, optional)
```

**Philosophy borrowed from homelab community**:
- **Modular Docker Compose**: Each service in its own directory with dedicated compose file
  - Master `docker-compose.yml` uses `include` directive
  - Easy to add/remove services without touching monolithic files
- **Nginx Proxy Manager over Traefik/Caddy**: Web UI for SSL management
  - Easier for non-experts (Let's Encrypt auto-renewal via UI)
  - Still FOSS, just more accessible
- **Cloudflare DNS**: Free tier for DNS + SSL certificate management
- **Cloudflare Tunnel**: For selective public exposure (free, always useful)
- **MergerFS + SnapRAID over ZFS/RAID**: Works with mixed drive sizes, lower RAM overhead
- **Tailscale over VPNs**: Zero-config mesh networking
- **SOPS + Age for secrets management**: Single source of truth with encryption

### 1.1.2 Conscious Tradeoffs

- We choose FOSS even when it costs ops work
- We allow swappable proprietary options behind interfaces

## 1.2 Archon Principles (Always On)

These rules apply to every project ONE_SHOT builds:

- **Validate Before Create**: Check environment, dependencies, and connectivity before generating code or infra.
- **WHY Documentation**: For any non-trivial choice, document why, not just how.
- **Systematic Debugging**: Isolate layer → Check dependencies → Analyze logs → Verify health endpoints.
- **Health First**: Every long-running service exposes a `/health` endpoint.
- **Future-You Documentation**: Write docs and code for yourself in 6 months when you've forgotten everything.

### 1.2.1 Future-You Documentation Standards

**Every non-obvious decision needs documentation**:

#### In Code:
```python
# Good: Explains WHY
# Using SQLite instead of Postgres because:
# 1. Single-file portability (easy backup)
# 2. No server overhead
# 3. Handles our 100K records fine
# Will upgrade to Postgres if we hit 500K records or need multi-user
db = sqlite3.connect("project.db")

# Bad: Just states WHAT
db = sqlite3.connect("project.db")
```

#### In README:
**Required sections for all projects**:

1. **Architecture Decisions** - Why this stack?
2. **Upgrade Triggers** - When to change technology?
3. **Known Limitations** - What doesn't this do?
4. **Troubleshooting** - Issues you've actually hit and solutions

## 1.3 Simplicity First (Core Principle)

**Before building anything, ask: Does this already exist?**

- **Prefer existing solutions** over building from scratch
- If a library/tool does 80% of what you need:
  - Fork it (give credit, follow license)
  - Wrap it with a thin layer for your use case
  - Document what you're doing and why
- **Building from scratch is the last resort**, not the first

### 1.3.1 The Upgrade Path Principle

**Start with the simplest thing that works, upgrade only when you hit limits.**

**Storage progression**:
1. **Files (YAML/JSON)** → works for < 1K items
2. **SQLite** → works for < 100K items
3. **PostgreSQL** → only when you need multi-user or > 100K items with heavy writes

**Deployment progression**:
1. **Local script** → works for personal use
2. **systemd service** → works for 24/7 single-machine
3. **Docker Compose** → works for multi-service
4. **Kubernetes** → only if you need multi-machine orchestration (you probably don't)

### 1.3.2 The "Works on My Machine" is Actually Good

**ONE_SHOT projects run on**:
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (homelab standard)
- Mac (development)
- OCI Always Free Tier (cloud)

This is a feature, not a bug. You know these environments intimately.

## 1.4 Web & UX Philosophy (When Web Exists)

- Modern, clean, and responsive.
- Real typography (Google Fonts), no browser defaults.
- Thoughtful color palettes, no generic red/blue/green.
- Micro-interactions (hover, focus, transitions) without bloat.
- SEO basics: good titles, meta descriptions, semantic HTML.

## 1.5 AI & Agents Philosophy (Optional)

- AI is optional. No AI if you don't explicitly ask for it.
- When used:
  - **Default provider**: OpenRouter (unified API for multiple models)
  - **Default model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite (`google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite`)
    - **Very cheap** (~$0.10-0.30/M tokens)
    - Ultra-low latency, fast token generation
    - **Use for 99% of AI tasks** - it's good enough
  - **Upgrade models** (only when Flash Lite genuinely fails):
    - `anthropic/claude-3-5-haiku`: When Flash Lite gives bad results (~$0.80/M tokens)
    - `anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet`: Complex code generation (~$3/M tokens)
    - `anthropic/claude-3-opus`: Mission-critical code, rarely needed (~$15/M tokens)

### 1.5.1 Cost Philosophy

**Reality check**:
- Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite handles **99% of AI tasks** just fine
- Typical usage: $0.50-2/month
- Only upgrade if Flash Lite genuinely fails, not "just in case"
- **Total AI cost target**: $1-3/month for most projects

## 1.6 Project Invariants (MUSTs)

For every ONE_SHOT project, the agent MUST ensure:

- **Documentation**
  - [ ] A `README.md` with clear one-line description, Current Tier, Upgrade Trigger, Quick Start (≤5 commands)
  - [ ] An `LLM-OVERVIEW.md` (NEW in v1.8) - complete project context for any LLM
  - [ ] A PRD file in the repo (name can be `PRD.md` or similar)

- **Scripts**
  - [ ] `scripts/setup.sh`
  - [ ] `scripts/start.sh`
  - [ ] `scripts/stop.sh`
  - [ ] `scripts/status.sh`
  - [ ] `scripts/process.sh` if there is any recurring/batch work

- **Services** (if Web Application, AI-Powered Web Application, or Background Service)
  - [ ] A `/health` endpoint
  - [ ] A `/metrics` endpoint OR a documented reason why not
  - [ ] A clear deployment path documented in README

- **Storage Discipline**
  - [ ] Agent MUST NOT introduce PostgreSQL without explicit human approval if Data Scale is A or B
  - [ ] Storage tier and upgrade trigger MUST be explicitly documented

- **Complexity Control**
  - [ ] No abstract factories / deep inheritance trees unless there are ≥3 real implementations
  - [ ] For small CLIs, keep modules small and direct; no premature layering

<!-- SECTION:2:CORE_QUESTIONS -->

# 2. CORE QUESTIONS (REQUIRED FOR ANY PROJECT)

<!-- SECTION:2.0:PRIME_DIRECTIVE -->

## 2.0 THE PRIME DIRECTIVE: FRONT-LOAD EVERYTHING

**This is the most important principle in ONE_SHOT.**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  USER TIME IS PRECIOUS. AGENT COMPUTE TIME IS CHEAP.                │
│                                                                     │
│  Ask ALL questions ONCE, UPFRONT.                                   │
│  Get ALL information BEFORE writing ANY code.                       │
│  Then execute AUTONOMOUSLY for hours without interruption.          │
│                                                                     │
│  The user should be able to walk away after saying:                 │
│  "PRD approved. Execute autonomous build."                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2.0.1 Information Gathering Rules

**Agent MUST**:
1. Ask ALL Core Questions in ONE message (or as few as possible)
2. Validate answers IMMEDIATELY - catch problems before coding starts
3. If answers are ambiguous, clarify NOW, not 2 hours into the build
4. If new information is needed mid-build, BATCH questions together
5. NEVER interrupt for something that could have been asked upfront

**Agent MUST NOT**:
- Ask one question, wait for answer, ask next question (drip-feed)
- Interrupt mid-build to ask "should I also do X?"
- Ask for approval on obvious next steps
- Ask the same question in different forms
- Discover missing requirements after starting implementation

### 2.0.2 Question Tiers (Speed vs Thoroughness)

| Tier | Questions | When to Ask |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Must Answer** | Q0, Q1, Q2, Q6, Q12 | Always - no defaults possible |
| **If Non-Default** | Q2.5, Q3-Q5, Q7-Q11, Q13 | Only if user's needs differ from smart defaults |

### 2.0.3 Yolo Mode (For Experienced Users)

**Trigger**: User says "yolo mode" or "fast mode"

**Flow**:
1. Ask only must-answer questions (Q0, Q1, Q2, Q6, Q12)
2. Propose smart defaults for everything else
3. Show summary: "Using these defaults: [list]. Proceed? (yes/override)"
4. On "yes" → Generate PRD immediately

**Smart Defaults by Project Type**:

| Q6 Type | Stack | Structure | Storage |
|---------|-------|-----------|---------|
| A. CLI Tool | Python, Click | Flat | SQLite |
| B. Library | Python, pytest | Modular | N/A |
| C. Web App | FastAPI, Jinja2 | Domain-driven | SQLite |
| D. Data Pipeline | Python, pandas | Flat | SQLite |
| E. Background Service | Python, APScheduler | Flat | SQLite |
| F. AI Web App | FastAPI, OpenRouter | Domain-driven | SQLite |
| G. Static Page | HTML/CSS/JS | Flat | N/A |

### 2.0.4 Quick Mode Reference

| Mode | Questions | User Time | Output |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Micro** | Q1, Q6, Q11 only | 1-2 min | Single file |
| **Yolo** | 5 must-answer | 3-5 min | Full project |
| **Normal** | All Core Questions | 10-15 min | Full project |
| **Heavy** | All + AI/Agent Qs | 15-20 min | Full project + AI |

## 2.1 MICRO MODE: The Fast Path

**Trigger**: User says "micro mode" OR describes a script <100 lines

**Micro mode is for**:
- Single-file scripts
- Quick utilities
- One-off automation
- Learning exercises

### Micro Mode Flow (1-2 minutes total)

```yaml
micro_mode_flow:
  step_1_detect:
    trigger_phrases:
      - "micro mode"
      - "quick script"
      - "simple script that..."
      - "one-liner" / "one file"
    auto_detect: "Description implies <100 lines, no services"

  step_2_ask:
    questions:
      - "What should this script do? (Q1)"
      - "CLI with args, or just run it? (Q11 simplified)"
    skip_entirely:
      - Q0 (mode) - already micro
      - Q2 (problem) - implied by Q1
      - Q2.5 (reality check) - micro = low investment
      - Q3-Q5 (philosophy, features, non-goals) - overkill
      - Q6 (project type) - default to CLI Tool
      - Q7-Q10 (data, storage, deps) - inline decisions
      - Q12 (done) - "it runs without errors"
      - Q13 (naming) - derive from description

  step_3_defaults:
    Q6: "A (CLI Tool)"
    Q12: "Script runs without errors"
    naming: "Derived from description (e.g., 'rename_jpeg.py')"
    structure: "Single file, no directories"
    testing: "Manual run = test"
    documentation: "Inline comments only"

  step_4_output:
    deliverables:
      - "Single script file with shebang"
      - "Inline comments for non-obvious logic"
      - "Usage example in file header"
    skip_deliverables:
      - README.md
      - PRD.md
      - LLM-OVERVIEW.md
      - scripts/ directory
      - .oneshot/ directory
    optional:
      - ".oneshot/micro_log.txt for history tracking"
```

**Example Micro Interaction**:

```
User: "Micro mode. Script that renames all .jpeg files to .jpg in current dir."

Agent: "Got it. Two quick questions:
1. Should it be recursive (subdirectories)?
2. Dry-run option to preview changes?

Or just the basics?"

User: "Just basics, current dir only."

Agent: [Produces rename_jpeg.py - done in 30 seconds]
```

**Micro Output Template**:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
rename_jpeg.py - Renames .jpeg files to .jpg in current directory

Usage:
    python rename_jpeg.py

Created via ONE_SHOT micro mode.
"""

import os
from pathlib import Path

def main():
    for f in Path('.').glob('*.jpeg'):
        new_name = f.with_suffix('.jpg')
        f.rename(new_name)
        print(f"Renamed: {f} -> {new_name}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### When to Upgrade from Micro

If any of these become true, upgrade to Tiny or Normal mode:
- Script exceeds 100 lines
- Need persistent storage
- Need to run as service
- Need tests
- Will be used by others

---

## Q0. Mode (Scope)

Choose ONE. This controls how much of ONE_SHOT the agent applies.

- **Tiny** – Single CLI/script, no services, no web, no AI.
- **Normal** – CLI or simple web/API on one box. Archon patterns, health checks, basic ops.
- **Heavy** – Multi-service and/or AI agents, MCP, full ops.

**Your choice**:
```
[Tiny / Normal / Heavy]
```

**Agent rules for Q0 (Mode)**:
- MUST ask Q0 first for any new ONE_SHOT project.
- MUST map the answer to `oneshot.modes[mode]` from the YAML header.
- MUST respect that mode's `skip_sections`.

Concretely:
- **Tiny** → skip Section 4 (Web & AI) and Sections 7.4–7.5 (AI & Deployment).
- **Normal** → apply Archon ops + health checks; AI optional.
- **Heavy** → enable AI, Agent SDK/MCP (if requested), AI cost tracking, and full ops patterns.

## Q1. What Are You Building?

One sentence: "A tool that does X for Y people."

**Your answer**:
```
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
```

---

## Q2. What Problem Does This Solve?

Why does this exist? What is painful or impossible without it?

**Your answer**:
```
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
```

---

## Q2.5 The Reality Check

**Before building anything, validate you have a real problem.**

### Do you actually have this problem right now?
- [ ] Yes, I hit this issue **weekly** (strong build signal)
- [ ] Yes, I hit this issue **monthly** (moderate build signal)
- [ ] No, but I might someday (**WARNING**: Don't build it)
- [ ] No, this is a learning project (**Mark as such in README**)

### What's your current painful workaround?
```
[Describe exactly what you do manually now, including frequency and pain points]
```

**If you don't have a workaround, you might not have a real problem.**

### What's the simplest thing that would help?
```
[Describe the 20% solution that gives 80% of the value]
```

**Build this first. Everything else is v2+.**

### How will you know it's working?
```
[Observable outcome with measurable results, not "it exists"]
```

### The "Would I Use This Tomorrow?" Test

**Imagine the project is done. Tomorrow morning, you need to**:
```
[Describe a specific task you'd do with this tool]
```

**If you can't describe a specific task, stop and reconsider the project.**

### Project Validation Checklist

Before proceeding, ensure:
- [ ] Real problem with current painful workaround
- [ ] Specific, measurable success criteria
- [ ] Concrete "tomorrow morning" use case
- [ ] Learning projects explicitly marked as such

**Agent rules for Q2.5 (Reality Check)**:
- If the user selects "No, but I might someday" AND does **not** mark it as a learning project:
  - Agent MUST stop after PRD generation.
  - Agent MUST NOT proceed unless the user types: `Override Reality Check`

---

## Q3. Project Philosophy (3–6 bullets)

These drive architectural decisions.

Examples:
- Simplicity over features
- Local-first, no external cloud
- CLI only, no GUI
- Each module < 300 lines
- Works offline

**Your answer** (bullets):
```
- ...
- ...
- ...
```

---

## Q4. What Will It DO? (Features)

List 3–7 concrete capabilities.

**Your answer**:
```
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
```

---

## Q5. What Will It NOT Do? (Non-Goals)

Explicitly exclude things to stop scope creep.

**Your answer**:
```
- ...
- ...
- ...
```

---

## Q6. Project Type

Choose one (this drives defaults):
- **A.** CLI Tool (commands, flags, local execution)
- **B.** Python Library (importable, reusable functions)
- **C.** Web Application (API + frontend + DB)
- **D.** Data Pipeline (ETL, scheduled jobs)
- **E.** Background Service (24/7 monitoring, alerts)
- **F.** AI-Powered Web Application
- **G.** Static / Landing Page (premium design, minimal backend)

# 3. DEFAULTS & ADVANCED OPTIONS

If you don't care, ONE_SHOT picks sane defaults based on Q6.

## 3.1 Directory Structure (Q16)

- **A.** Flat (`src/*.py`)
- **B.** Modular (`src/module1/`, `src/module2/`)
- **C.** Domain-driven (`src/models/`, `src/services/`, `src/api/`)
- **D.** Let ONE_SHOT choose based on project type

**Defaults**:
- CLI / small tools → A (Flat)
- Web apps / services → C (Domain-driven)

## 3.2 Testing Strategy (Q17)

- **A.** Minimal (critical paths)
- **B.** Thorough (~80% coverage target)
- **C.** Comprehensive (near 100%)
- **D.** ONE_SHOT decides based on complexity

**Defaults**:
- CLI: A/B depending on complexity
- Web apps / services: B

## 3.3 Deployment Preference (Q18)

- **A.** Local dev only
- **B.** Tailscale HTTPS (e.g. `https://project.your-tailnet.ts.net`)
- **C.** Systemd service (24/7)
- **D.** Both Tailscale + systemd

**Runtime**:
- OCI Always Free Tier VM
- Homelab (i5, 16GB, Ubuntu)
- Local only

## 3.4 Secrets & Env (Q19)

**Choose your secrets management approach**:

- **A.** No secrets needed
- **B.** Traditional `.env` file (unencrypted, for development only)
- **C.** SOPS + Age encryption (recommended for production/shared teams)

**See Section 18 for complete SOPS + Age setup.**

---

# 4. OPTIONAL: WEB DESIGN & AI

Skip entire Section 4 if you don't want web / AI.

## 4.1 Web Design (Q20–Q22)

Only relevant for Web / AI Web / Landing projects.

**Aesthetic**: Modern & Minimal / Bold & Vibrant / Dark & Sleek / Professional & Corporate / Creative & Playful / ONE_SHOT decides / N/A

**Color scheme**: Monochrome / Complementary / Analogous / ONE_SHOT decides / N/A

**Animation level**: Minimal / Moderate / Rich / N/A

## 4.2 AI Features (Q23)

**Do you want AI?**
- No AI
- Yes, with these capabilities: Content generation / Intelligent search / Recommendations / Chat UI / Data analysis / Other

**Budget**: Minimal ($0–5/month) / Moderate ($5–20/month) / Flexible ($20+/month)

## 4.3 Agent Architecture (Q24)

**Decision rule**:
- If AI is requested AND project has multi-step workflows with tools → Use **Agent SDK with MCP**
- Else → Use **simple API calls**

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**:
- Open standard for connecting AI to tools
- Works with any model
- Pre-built servers: Filesystem, GitHub, Slack, PostgreSQL, Brave Search, Google Drive

<!-- SECTION:5:ENVIRONMENT_VALIDATION -->

# 5. ENVIRONMENT VALIDATION

ONE_SHOT always validates environment before building.

## 5.1 Validation Script

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

**Usage**: Run `./scripts/oneshot_doctor.sh` to validate project health.

## 5.5 Using ONE_SHOT with Existing Projects

ONE_SHOT isn't just for greenfield projects. You can apply its patterns incrementally.

### Progressive Adoption Approach

1. **Observability First** (Always): Add health/metrics endpoints, status scripts
2. **Documentation Upgrade**: Enhance README with current tier/upgrade triggers
3. **Secrets Management**: Add SOPS + Age for sensitive configs
4. **Scripts & Automation**: Add setup.sh if missing

### Agent Rules for Existing Projects

- **Don't recreate** - analyze existing architecture first
- **Respect current constraints** - databases, frameworks, deployment patterns
- **Focus on pain points** - apply ONE_SHOT patterns where they provide immediate value
- **Progressive enhancement** - start with observability, then documentation, then automation

---

<!-- SECTION:6:PRD_GENERATION -->

# 6. PRD GENERATION

Once Core Questions are answered, ONE_SHOT generates a **Project Requirements Document**.

## 6.0 Agent Rules for PRD-First Changes

When `ONE_SHOT.md` is present in a repo:

- Any non-trivial change MUST:
  1. Re-check relevant Core Questions
  2. Update the PRD
  3. Only then modify code/tests/scripts

## 6.1 PRD Schema (Required Shape)

Every ONE_SHOT PRD MUST follow this structure:

1. **Overview** - 3–8 sentences summarizing what, for whom, why now
2. **Problem & Reality Check** - Core problem, current workaround, 80/20 solution
3. **Philosophy & Constraints** - Project philosophy, non-goals, mode
4. **Features** - 3–7 capabilities, marked `v1` or `later`
5. **Data Model** - YAML examples, formal schema
6. **Storage & Upgrade Path** - Storage choice, scale, tier label, upgrade trigger
7. **Interfaces** - CLI commands, API routes, or library API
8. **Architecture & Deployment** - Project type, stack, where it runs, deployment path
9. **Testing Strategy** - Testing level, what gets tested
10. **AI & Agents** (if applicable) - Whether AI is used, provider/model, cost target
11. **v1 Scope vs Future Work** - v1 features, deferred work, "done when..."

## 6.2 PRD Approval

**You say**:
```
PRD approved. Execute autonomous build.
```

At that point the agent stops asking questions and moves to execution.

---

<!-- SECTION:7:AUTONOMOUS_EXECUTION -->

# 7. AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION PIPELINE

ONE_SHOT's build loop, assuming PRD is approved.

## 7.1 Phase 0: Repo & Skeleton

- Create GitHub repo with the name from Q13
- Clone into `~/github/[project]`
- Initialize project layout
- Add `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore`
- **Create LLM-OVERVIEW.md**
- **Initialize checkpoint tracking**:

### Initialize Checkpoint Tracking

```bash
# Create checkpoint directory structure
mkdir -p .oneshot/checkpoints
touch .oneshot/checkpoint.yaml
echo "# ONE_SHOT Decision Log - $(date -I)" > .oneshot/decisions.log
```

**Initial checkpoint.yaml**:
```yaml
checkpoint:
  oneshot_version: "2.0"      # Spec version this project uses
  checkpoint_schema: "1.0"    # Checkpoint format version
  project: [PROJECT_NAME]
  created: [ISO_TIMESTAMP]
  last_updated: [ISO_TIMESTAMP]

  session:
    current_phase: "Phase 0: Repo & Skeleton"
    current_task: "Initial setup"
    completion_percentage: 0

  progress:
    completed: []
    in_progress: []
    pending:
      - "Phase 1: Core Implementation"
      - "Phase 2: Tests"
      - "Phase 3: Scripts"
      - "Phase 4: Deployment"

  decisions_made: []
  blockers: []
```

### Required Initial Files

**README.md**:
```markdown
# [Project Name] - [One-line description]

**Status**: In Development
**Current Tier**: [Storage/Deployment tier]
**Upgrade Trigger**: [When to upgrade]

## What This Does
[Problem → Solution in 2-3 sentences]

## Quick Start
[≤5 commands to get running]
```

**LLM-OVERVIEW.md** (NEW in v1.8):
```markdown
# LLM-OVERVIEW: [Project Name]

This file provides complete context for any LLM to understand this project.
Updated: [DATE]

## What This Project Is
[2-3 paragraph explanation]

## Current State
[What works, what's in progress, what's broken]

## Key Files and Their Purpose
[File: Purpose list]

## Architecture Decisions
[Why we chose X over Y]

## How to Contribute
[What an AI should know before making changes]
```

## 7.2 Phase 1: Core Implementation (Data-First Order)

**Implementation order is critical. Follow this sequence**:

1. **Define Data Models** - `models.py` with complete data structures
2. **Define Storage Schema** - Database schema or file format
3. **Implement Storage Layer** - CRUD operations
4. **Build Processing Logic** - Business logic
5. **Create Interface** - CLI, API, or UI

## 7.3 Phase 2: Tests

- Write tests for critical paths
- Run tests and fix failures
- Document test commands in README

## 7.4 Phase 3: Scripts

Create required automation scripts:

```bash
scripts/
├── setup.sh     # One-time setup (deps, DB, secrets)
├── start.sh     # Start the service
├── stop.sh      # Stop the service
├── status.sh    # Check service health
└── process.sh   # Batch/recurring work (if needed)
```

## 7.5 Phase 4: Deployment

- Create systemd unit file (if 24/7 service)
- Create Docker Compose (if containerized)
- Document deployment in README
- Test health endpoints

---

<!-- SECTION:7.6:RESUME_PROTOCOL -->

## 7.6 SESSION CONTINUITY: RESUME PROTOCOL

Sessions get interrupted. Context windows fill up. Machines crash. This section ensures work survives.

### 7.6.1 Checkpoint System

**Every ONE_SHOT project maintains a checkpoint file**:

```yaml
# .oneshot/checkpoint.yaml
checkpoint:
  oneshot_version: "1.9"      # Spec version this was created under
  checkpoint_schema: "1.0"    # Checkpoint format version
  project: project-name
  last_updated: 2024-12-06T14:32:00Z

  session:
    current_phase: "Phase 1: Core Implementation"
    current_task: "Implement storage layer"
    completion_percentage: 45

  progress:
    completed:
      - "Phase 0: Repo & Skeleton"
      - "Define data models"
      - "Define storage schema"
    in_progress:
      - task: "Implement storage layer"
        status: "CRUD operations 3/5 done"
        files_modified:
          - src/storage.py
          - tests/test_storage.py
    pending:
      - "Build processing logic"
      - "Create CLI interface"
      - "Write tests"

  decisions_made:
    - decision: "Use SQLite over files"
      reason: "Need querying, expect 10K+ records"
      date: 2024-12-06

  blockers: []

  files_changed_this_session:
    - src/models.py
    - src/storage.py
```

### 7.6.2 When to Update Checkpoint

**Agent MUST update checkpoint**:
- After completing any task
- Before context window reaches 70% capacity
- When switching to a new phase
- When hitting a blocker
- At end of any session

### 7.6.3 Resume Command

**User says**: `Resume from checkpoint`

**Agent MUST**:
1. Read `.oneshot/checkpoint.yaml`
2. Read `LLM-OVERVIEW.md` for full context
3. Read the PRD for requirements
4. Summarize current state to user
5. Confirm next action before proceeding

**Resume summary format**:
```markdown
## Session Resume

**Project**: [name]
**Last checkpoint**: [timestamp]

**Completed**:
- [x] Task 1
- [x] Task 2

**In Progress**:
- [ ] Task 3 (50% - [status details])

**Next Action**: [exact next step]

Ready to continue?
```

### 7.6.4 Checkpoint Directory Structure

```
.oneshot/
├── checkpoint.yaml      # Current state
├── checkpoints/         # Historical checkpoints (optional)
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD.yaml
└── decisions.log        # Running log of decisions made
```

---

<!-- SECTION:7.7:HANDOFF_PROTOCOL -->

## 7.7 SESSION HANDOFF PROTOCOL

When switching agents (Claude Code → Cursor), models, or machines, use this standardized handoff.

### 7.7.1 Quick Handoff Template

When ending a session or switching contexts, generate this:

```markdown
## HANDOFF STATE
**Project**: [project-name]
**Timestamp**: [ISO timestamp]
**Agent**: [Claude Code / Cursor / etc.]

### Last Completed
- [Phase X, Task Y - specific description]

### Currently Blocked On (if any)
- [Issue description]
- [What was tried]
- [Why it failed]

### Next Action (BE SPECIFIC)
1. Open file: `[exact path]`
2. Find function: `[function name]`
3. Do: [exact change needed]

### Files Changed This Session
- `src/storage.py` - Added CRUD operations
- `tests/test_storage.py` - Added 5 test cases

### Decisions Made This Session
- Chose X over Y because Z

### Context the Next Agent Needs
- [Important detail 1]
- [Important detail 2]
```

### 7.7.2 Handoff Triggers

**Generate handoff when**:
- User says "handoff", "switch agent", "take a break"
- Context window exceeds 80%
- Agent detects it's looping or stuck
- Before any session end

### 7.7.3 Receiving a Handoff

**When starting with a handoff, agent MUST**:
1. Read the handoff document
2. Read `LLM-OVERVIEW.md`
3. Read the PRD
4. Verify "Next Action" is still valid
5. Confirm understanding before proceeding

### 7.7.4 Handoff vs LLM-OVERVIEW vs Checkpoint

| Document | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| LLM-OVERVIEW.md | Full project context | Milestones |
| Handoff | Session state transfer | Every session |
| Checkpoint | Machine-readable state | Continuous |

**Use together**: LLM-OVERVIEW for "what is this project", Handoff for "what was I just doing", Checkpoint for precise state recovery.

# 8-10. DEPLOYMENT, OPS, AI INTEGRATION

## 8. Health Endpoints

Every long-running service needs:

```python
@app.get("/health")
async def health():
    """Health check endpoint."""
    return {
        "status": "healthy",
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "dependencies": {
            "database": check_db(),
            "redis": check_redis() if REDIS_ENABLED else "disabled"
        }
    }

@app.get("/metrics")
async def metrics():
    """Basic metrics endpoint."""
    return {
        "uptime_seconds": get_uptime(),
        "requests_total": REQUEST_COUNT,
        "errors_total": ERROR_COUNT
    }
```

## 9. Observability Patterns

### Status Script Template

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/status.sh

echo "=== [Project] Status ==="
echo "Timestamp: $(date -Iseconds)"

# Service status
if systemctl is-active --quiet project; then
    echo "Service: RUNNING"
else
    echo "Service: STOPPED"
fi

# Health check
if curl -sf http://localhost:8000/health > /dev/null; then
    echo "Health: HEALTHY"
else
    echo "Health: UNHEALTHY"
fi

# Resource usage
echo "Memory: $(free -h | awk '/Mem:/ {print $3 "/" $2}')"
echo "Disk: $(df -h / | awk 'NR==2 {print $3 "/" $2}')"
```

## 10. AI Cost Management

```python
import sqlite3
from datetime import datetime

class AIUsageTracker:
    def __init__(self, db_path: str = "ai_usage.db"):
        self.db = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
        self._init_db()

    def _init_db(self):
        self.db.execute("""
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS usage (
                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                timestamp TEXT,
                model TEXT,
                input_tokens INTEGER,
                output_tokens INTEGER,
                estimated_cost REAL
            )
        """)
        self.db.commit()

    def log(self, model: str, input_tokens: int, output_tokens: int):
        cost = self._estimate_cost(model, input_tokens, output_tokens)
        self.db.execute("""
            INSERT INTO usage (timestamp, model, input_tokens, output_tokens, estimated_cost)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
        """, (datetime.utcnow().isoformat(), model, input_tokens, output_tokens, cost))
        self.db.commit()

    def monthly_cost(self) -> float:
        result = self.db.execute("""
            SELECT SUM(estimated_cost) FROM usage
            WHERE timestamp >= date('now', 'start of month')
        """).fetchone()
        return result[0] or 0.0
```

# 11. CANONICAL EXAMPLES

## 11.1 Minimal: Local-Only CLI Finance Tracker

- **Type**: A (CLI Tool)
- **Storage**: SQLite
- **No AI, no web, local only**

```bash
finance import transactions.csv
finance categorize
finance report --month 2024-01
finance export --category groceries
```

## 11.2 Medium: Non-AI Web App Dashboard

- **Type**: C (Web Application)
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL
- **Web**: FastAPI backend + simple frontend
- **Deployment**: systemd + Tailscale

## 11.3 Complex: AI Code Review with Subagents

- **Type**: F (AI-Powered Web Application)
- **AI**: Yes, Agent SDK with MCP

---

# 12. GOAL VS BASELINE

## 12.1 Baseline Contract

For every ONE_SHOT project:
- A PRD is generated and kept in the repo
- An LLM-OVERVIEW.md exists (NEW in v1.8)
- Code compiles/runs for the v1 scope
- At least minimal test suite for critical paths
- Long-running services have `/health`
- README explains how to run and deploy

## 12.2 Goal State (Stretch)

- Fully autonomous build from PRD to deployed system
- Clean commits per milestone
- Integrated AI agents where appropriate
- Robust test coverage and CI

---

# 13. ANTI-PATTERNS (Learn from Past Mistakes)

## 13.1 Complexity Creep

**Anti-Pattern**: Adding abstraction layers "for flexibility"

```python
# Bad: Over-engineered (1,363 lines)
class AbstractDataProviderFactory:
    def create_provider(self, provider_type: str) -> AbstractDataProvider:
        ...

# Good: Simple and direct (104 lines)
def get_data(source: str) -> dict:
    if source.endswith('.json'):
        return json.load(open(source))
    elif source.endswith('.yaml'):
        return yaml.safe_load(open(source))
```

**Rule**: Only add abstraction when you have 3+ implementations

## 13.2 Building Before Validating

**Always**: Phase 0 (Validate) → Phase 1 (Build)

## 13.3 Over-Engineering Storage

**Anti-Pattern**: Use PostgreSQL for everything

**Better Pattern**: Files → SQLite → PostgreSQL (only when needed)

**Real-world validation**: Divorce project runs 135K records in SQLite with sub-second queries

## 13.4 No Rollback Plan

**Always have**: `scripts/rollback.sh` or equivalent

---

<!-- SECTION:13.5:FAILURE_RECOVERY -->

## 13.5 FAILURE MODES & RECOVERY

  steps:
    1_isolate:
      action: "Identify failing component"

# 14. META: LIVING IDEA REPOSITORY

ONE_SHOT is also your idea sink for future improvements.

## 14.1 Rules for Updating This File

- **You don't hand-edit structure**
- Tell the agent: "Add this concept: [idea]"
- The agent integrates new ideas, keeps Core Questions compact, avoids duplication

## 14.2 File Size & Growth Guidelines

**Current state**: ~13K tokens (~50K characters, ~3,000 lines)
**Growth ceiling**: 30-40K tokens before considering restructure

### Why Single File Works

1. **Agent loads once**: File is parsed at session start, not re-read constantly
2. **Context window is large**: 100K+ tokens available; we use ~10-15%
3. **Simplicity**: One file to clone, one file to update, one source of truth

### When Single File Breaks Down

Watch for these signals:
- Agent "forgets" later sections without explicit references
- Part IV (appendix) exceeds 40% of total file size
- You find yourself saying "see Section X" constantly
- New users are overwhelmed finding relevant sections

### Growth Rules

| Content Type | Where to Add | When to Add |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Core patterns | Part I (Sections 0-7) | Used in >50% of projects |
| Supporting patterns | Part I (Sections 8-16) | Used in >25% of projects |
| Reference material | Part II-III | Needed but not core |
| Skills & templates | Part IV (Appendix) | Lookup only |

### If Restructure Needed (Future)

If file exceeds 40K tokens, consider:

```
ONE_SHOT.md          # Core spec (Parts I-III, ~25K tokens)
SKILLS_REFERENCE.md  # Part IV extracted (~15K tokens)
```

With ONE_SHOT.md containing:
```yaml
companion_files:
  skills: SKILLS_REFERENCE.md
  load: "On demand when skills needed"
```

**But not yet.** Current size is healthy. Revisit at 30K tokens.

# 15. VERSION HISTORY

- **v2.1** (2024-12-06)
  - **NEW**: TRIAGE LAYER (Section 0.0) - First Contact Protocol
    - Intent Classification: build_new, fix_existing, continue_work, modify, understand, quick_task
    - Diagnostic Mode for "it's broken" scenarios (don't run full ONE_SHOT for bugs)
    - Context Recovery Protocol for partial handoffs
    - Scope Assessment for modifications (micro/small/medium/large)
    - Graceful Degradation when ONE_SHOT is overkill
    - "I'm Lost" Recovery - what to do when confused
    - Environment Mismatch Detection
  - **EXTRACTED**: Skills moved to secrets-vault/SKILLS.md
    - Reduced one_shot.md from ~25K to ~18K tokens
    - Added designer skill (9 skills total)
    - secrets-vault is now the "companion repo" for shared resources
  - **NEW**: Companion repository pattern
    - secrets-vault holds: SKILLS.md, secrets.env.encrypted, homelab.env
    - ONE_SHOT = spec, secrets-vault = resource dump
    - Agents fetch skills on-demand via URL or local path
  - **RATIONALE**: Agents need to understand WHAT the user needs before deciding HOW to help. Skills extraction keeps core spec lean while full detail remains accessible.

- **v2.0** (2024-12-06)
  - **ARCHITECTURE**: File structure optimized for long-term growth
    - Added growth ceiling guidance (~30-40K tokens max)
    - Added priority ordering for agent attention
    - Marked Part IV as appendix (skim, don't memorize)
    - Added section markers for navigation (`<!-- SECTION:X:NAME -->`)
  - **NEW**: Micro mode explicit flow (Section 2.1)
    - Complete fast-path for <100 line scripts
    - 2 questions → single file output
  - **NEW**: oneshot_doctor.sh v2.0 (Section 5.3)
    - Project health validation script

  - **NEW**: Hard stop override pattern
    - Explicit `OVERRIDE: [stop_id]` syntax
    - All overrides logged to decisions.log
  - **ENHANCED**: Reference sections marked for on-demand loading
  - **RATIONALE**: Prepare ONE_SHOT for continued growth while maintaining single-file simplicity. Agent attention is finite; prioritize core flow.

- **v1.9** (2024-12-06)
  - **MAJOR**: PRIME DIRECTIVE - Front-load everything
    - New philosophy: User's time is precious, agent compute is cheap
    - All information gathering happens UPFRONT before any code
    - User can walk away after "PRD approved. Execute autonomous build."
  - **NEW**: Session Continuity (Section 7.6-7.7)
    - Resume Protocol with checkpoint.yaml
    - Handoff Protocol for switching agents/models
    - Recovery patterns for common failures

# PART II: LLM-OVERVIEW STANDARD

<!-- SECTION:17:LLM_OVERVIEW -->

# 17. LLM-OVERVIEW: THE PROJECT CONTEXT FILE

## 17.1 What Is LLM-OVERVIEW.md?

**Every ONE_SHOT project MUST have an `LLM-OVERVIEW.md` file.**

This file exists to give ANY LLM (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.) complete context about the project without needing access to the full repository.

**Use cases**:
- Get a second opinion from a different AI
- Have an off-site conversation about the project
- Onboard a new AI assistant quickly
- Document project state at milestones
- Enable async/parallel AI assistance

## 17.2 LLM-OVERVIEW Template

```

## 17.3 When to Update LLM-OVERVIEW.md

**Update during**:
- Major milestone completion
- Architecture changes
- Before seeking external AI help
- After significant refactoring
- When onboarding new contributors

**Don't update**:
- Every commit
- Minor bug fixes
- Typo corrections
- Test additions only

## 17.4 Agent Rules for LLM-OVERVIEW

- MUST create LLM-OVERVIEW.md during Phase 0 (Repo & Skeleton)
- MUST update when making architectural changes
- MUST keep accurate - outdated LLM-OVERVIEW is worse than none
- SHOULD include enough context that another AI could help without repo access

# PART III: SECRETS MANAGEMENT

<!-- SECTION:18:SECRETS_MANAGEMENT -->

> **📋 REFERENCE SECTION**: Load on demand.
> Only relevant when project needs secrets management.
> Skip if Q19 answer is "A. No secrets needed".

# 18. SECRETS MANAGEMENT (SOPS + Age)

## 18.1 Central Secrets Vault (Recommended)

**Philosophy**: Store ONE Age key in 1Password, get ALL secrets automatically.

### One-Time Setup

1. **Install tools**:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install age sops

# Mac
brew install age sops
```

2. **Generate Age key** (or get from 1Password):
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.age
age-keygen -o ~/.age/key.txt
# Save the public key (starts with age1...) and store in 1Password
```

3. **Clone secrets vault**:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Khamel83/secrets-vault.git ~/github/secrets-vault
```

4. **Create `.sops.yaml`** in secrets-vault:
```yaml
creation_rules:
  - path_regex: .*\.encrypted$
    age: 'age1your_public_key_here'
```

### Daily Usage

**Decrypt secrets to project**:
```bash
sops --decrypt ~/github/secrets-vault/secrets.env.encrypted > .env
source .env
```

**Update secrets**:
```bash
cd ~/github/secrets-vault
sops secrets.env.encrypted
# Edit in your editor, save, auto-encrypted
git add . && git commit -m "Update secrets" && git push
```

## 18.2 Standalone SOPS (Per-Project)

For work projects or isolated secrets:

```bash
# In your project directory
mkdir -p .sops
age-keygen -o .sops/key.txt

# Create .sops.yaml
cat > .sops.yaml << 'EOF'
creation_rules:
  - path_regex: \.encrypted$
    age: 'age1your_project_key_here'
EOF

# Create encrypted secrets
sops secrets.env.encrypted

# Decrypt for use
sops --decrypt secrets.env.encrypted > .env
```

## 18.3 Sharing ONE_SHOT with Others

### For Open Source

1. **Include `.env.example`** with all variable names (no values)
2. **Document SOPS setup** in README
3. **Never commit**: `.env`, `secrets.env`, `*.key`, `*_key`

### For Teams

1. **Share encrypted vault access** (add their public age key to `.sops.yaml`)
2. **Each person has their own Age key**
3. **Vault can be decrypted by any authorized key**

### .gitignore Template

```gitignore
# Secrets (NEVER commit)
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local
secrets.env
*.key
*_key
key.txt
.age/

# Allow examples
!.env.example
!secrets.env.example

# SOPS encrypted files ARE safe to commit
!*.encrypted
```

# PART IV: SKILLS REFERENCE (APPENDIX)

<!-- SECTION:19:SKILLS_REFERENCE -->

# 19. SKILLS (EXTERNAL REFERENCE)

**Full skills documentation has been moved to a dedicated file for better maintainability.**

## Quick Reference

```yaml
skills_reference:
  url: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Khamel83/secrets-vault/master/SKILLS.md"
  local: "~/github/secrets-vault/SKILLS.md"
  fetch_when: "Skill is needed - don't load on every session"
```

## Available Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Trigger Keywords |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| **project-initializer** | Bootstrap new projects | "new project", "initialize", "start fresh" |
| **feature-planner** | Break down features into tasks | "plan feature", "break down", "create plan" |
| **git-workflow** | Conventional commits & PRs | "commit", "PR", "conventional commits" |
| **code-reviewer** | Code quality & security review | "review code", "security check", "PR review" |
| **documentation-generator** | READMEs, ADRs, API docs | "generate docs", "README", "ADR" |
| **secrets-vault-manager** | SOPS + Age secrets management | "secrets", "API keys", "environment variables" |

| **marketplace-browser** | Find & install community skills | "find skill", "browse marketplace", "is there a skill for" |
| **designer** | Create beautiful web designs | "design", "website", "UI", "landing page" |

## How to Use

**Agent behavior**:
1. When a skill is triggered (by keyword or user request), fetch the full SKILLS.md
2. Read the specific skill section needed
3. Follow that skill's workflow

**Fetch command**:
```bash
# If on same machine as secrets-vault
cat ~/github/secrets-vault/SKILLS.md

# Or fetch from GitHub
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Khamel83/secrets-vault/master/SKILLS.md
```

**WebFetch for agents**:
```
URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Khamel83/secrets-vault/master/SKILLS.md
Prompt: "Find the [skill-name] skill and follow its workflow"
```
