# claude-sneakpeek Validation - Initial Findings

## Installation Results
✅ Successfully installed: `claudesp`
- Provider: mirror
- **Swarm mode: ENABLED**
- Team mode: unsupported (use 1.6.3 for legacy)
- Wrapper: `/home/ubuntu/.local/bin/claudesp`
- Config: `/home/ubuntu/.claude-sneakpeek/claudesp/config`

## Key Findings
1. **Swarm mode is available** - This validates that Anthropic has built native multi-agent features
2. **Current version (1.6.10) has swarm mode** - Team mode was legacy (1.6.3)
3. **ONE_SHOT v10's simplification is validated** - Native features are coming

## Next Steps (After Compact)
- Test claudesp to see TeammateTool in action
- Compare to ONE_SHOT v10 approach
- Document differences

## Beads Task
oneshot-czt - Install and test claude-sneakpeek [IN PROGRESS]
