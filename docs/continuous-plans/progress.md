# Progress

**2026-02-06** - Project portfolio analysis completed

## Completed
- ✅ Fetched and analyzed 18 projects
- ✅ Identified Tier 1 (HIGH impact): Atlas, RelayQ, Tablo, Frugalos
- ✅ Identified Tier 2 (MEDIUM impact): Networth, Poytz, Archon
- ✅ Identified Tier 3 (needs investigation): arb, vig, and 7 others
- ✅ Created findings.md with comprehensive recommendations
- ✅ Mapped ONE_SHOT v10 commands to each project

## Key Insights
1. **Atlas** is the ONE_SHOT reference project - already follows stack-defaults (SQLite→Convex)
2. **RelayQ** perfect for `/remote` + `/deploy` combo (OCI + runners)
3. **Tablo** should use `/remote` for macmini automation
4. **Networth** could save money by migrating from Vercel to oci-dev

## Next Session
- Run `/cp atlas-v2` to plan Convex migration
- Run `/cp relayq-prod` for runner orchestration
- Audit Tier 3 projects
