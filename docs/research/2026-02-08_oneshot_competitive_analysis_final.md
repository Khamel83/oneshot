# ONE_SHOT Competitive Analysis

**Date:** February 8, 2026
**Research Method:** WebSearch comprehensive analysis
**Goal:** Determine if ONE_SHOT should continue, sunset, or pivot

---

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation: CONTINUE with strategic pivot**

ONE_SHOT's core innovation—**progressive disclosure rules** (300 tokens vs 5,800)—is validated by the market. Multiple projects are converging on this pattern.

**However**, the landscape has shifted:
1. **Claude Code now has native Tasks** - One of ONE_SHOT's core value props
2. **Cursor/Windsurf have persistent memory** - Reducing need for custom solutions
3. **"Fire and forget" is still elusive** - Active supervision remains required

**Verdict:** ONE_SHOT should **pivot to a configuration pack**, not a framework.
