# /audit — Strategic Communication Filter

Transform raw emotional input into strategic output. Use before sending high-stakes messages
to employers, clients, partners, or anyone where emotional reactivity could backfire.

## Process

1. Read the raw input (the emotional/unfiltered version)
2. Identify the actual strategic objective (what outcome do they want?)
3. Strip emotional charge while preserving factual assertions
4. Reframe from the recipient's incentive structure
5. Apply the Voss principle: label emotions, don't express them
   - "It sounds like..." instead of "You always..."
   - "I notice..." instead of "You made me feel..."
6. Output a clean version that advances the strategic objective

## Guardrails
- Never soften legitimate boundaries — being strategic ≠ being passive
- Preserve the sender's core position and non-negotiables
- Flag if the original message has a valid point buried under emotion
- If the situation calls for directness, be direct — just be precise, not reactive
