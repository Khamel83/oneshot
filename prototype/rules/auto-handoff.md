# Auto-Handoff Rule

When you see a hook message saying context is at 80%+ or a handoff warning:

1. Finish your current thought/action
2. Automatically run the /handoff workflow — save decisions, progress, and next steps to a handoff file
3. Tell the user the handoff is saved and they can `/clear` and `/restore` to continue

Do not ask for permission. Just do it. Context loss is worse than interrupting flow.
