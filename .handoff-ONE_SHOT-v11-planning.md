oneshot-bsz [P2] [open] - Compare CC-MIRROR task tools vs beads
oneshot-0sx [P2] [open] - Get Gemini CLI CTO validation of plan
```

### 4. claude-sneakpeek Validation - IN PROGRESS
- ✅ Installed: `npx @realmikekelly/claude-sneakpeek quick --name claudesp`

## Next Session (After Compact)

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Test claudesp** - Run it and explore swarm mode/TeammateTool
2. **Check openclaw in penny** - See how it's being used
3. **Compare task tools** - CC-MIRROR vs beads
4. **Gemini CLI CTO review** - Get validation of plan

### Execution Phase (After Validation)
- Document ONE_SHOT v11 stance on native features
- Decide on task tools approach
- Implement progressive disclosure
- Update documentation

## Commit to Make
```bash
git add docs/continuous-plan-starred-repos/ .handoff-ONE_SHOT-*.md
git commit -m "feat: add v11 planning continuous plan + initial validation"
```

## Key Context
- User activated /compact - context will be compressed
- claude-sneakpeek installed with swarm mode ready to test
