# ONE_SHOT Starred Repos Analysis - Context Saved Before Compact

## Session Date
2026-02-06

## What We Did
Analyzed 10 starred GitHub repos for ONE_SHOT v11 relevance.

## Key Findings

### CRITICAL: claude-sneakpeek
- Anthropic's native swarm mode (TeammateTool) is feature-flagged
- Validates ONE_SHOT v10's simplification approach
- Next: Install and test to validate

### HIGH: cc-mirror
- Native task tools (TaskCreate, TaskGet, TaskUpdate, TaskList)
- Cleaner than external beads
- Next: Study for potential integration

### MEDIUM: awesome-claude-skills
- Progressive disclosure pattern
- Load rules contextually by project type

### Context: openclaw
- Already running in penny project
- User can validate patterns
